	<h5>Aeon Labs Heavy Duty Smart Switch - ZW078</h5>
	<span>
	<p>A device type for the Aeon Labs Heavy Duty Smart Switch from Aeotec</p>
	<p>This device supports the switch control as well as reporting on the power (in Watts), energy (in kWh), voltage (in Volts), and current (in Amps). 
	It also supports reporting the temperature (in C or F) but since it is at the circuit board level it is not a great representation of the room where the switch is installed.</p>
	<p>This device type also has some preferences you can set if you want to adjust the reporting interval of the values to the hub and if the switch responds to a "Switch All" event.</p>
